    "To create my model I first created dataframes that were comprised of 50% images of horses and 50% images of other things. The training dataframe had 10000 images in total, while the testing dataframe had 2000 images in total. Following this I then split the dataframes into 4 variables. These 4 variables were x_train, y_train, x_test and y_test. With these variables I converted them into lists so that they can be processed and used to generate a model.\n",

    "The shape of my model contains 1 Conv layer with 64 filters, 1 MaxPooling layer, 1 Flatten layer, 1 Dense layer with 128 nodes and 1 Dense layer with 1 node. I used the Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 0.0001 alongside the BinaryCrossentropy loss function. For metrics I used the accuracy metric. I trained the model for 20 epochs with a batch size of 1000 and used the TensorBoard callback and the EarlyStopping callback."

    "In conclusion, my generated model after fitting the training sets had a validation accuracy of ~81%. I am satisfied with this result as I managed to generate this model by only performing 20 epochs and know that with more time and epochs the model accuracy could be significantly higher. My generated model had a single Conv layer and 2 Dense layers, which means that the accuracy could potentially be improved by modifying the shape of my model by adding in more dense layers."
